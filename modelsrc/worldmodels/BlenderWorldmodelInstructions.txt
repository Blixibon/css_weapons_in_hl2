CS:S worldmodel to HL2 worldmodel in Blender using Blender Source Tools

1. Import the equivalent HL2 weapon worldmodel
2. Import the CS:S weapon worldmodel as a new armature
3. Import the CS:S weapon worldmodel collision mesh targeting the CS:S weapon worldmodel armature
3. Move the HL2 weapon worldmodel (and its armature) to be as closely aligned with the CS:S weapon as possible (triggers in same approximate locations, etc.)
4. Separate "ValveBiped.Bip01_R_Hand" from the HL2 armature
5. Join the separated bone with the CS:S armature
6. Go into the 'Animation' workspace and create a blank "idle" sequence for the CS:S armature w/ the new bone
7. Export the animation
8. Export the CS:S weapon worldmodel and the collision mesh



NOTE: Most HL2 viewmodels require the ValveBiped.Bip01_R_Hand bone roll to be tweaked post-translation to the appropriate alignment.
